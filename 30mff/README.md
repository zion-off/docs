  Project Name: NYUAD Matchmaking

  Project Description: Indian Matchmaking is a Netflix original series that follows Mumbai-based matchmaker Sima Taparia as she works to find appropriate matches for her clients in India and the United States. The series provides an inside look at the arranged marriage process in India, as well as the challenges that can come with it. It also explores the role of matchmakers in India's modern society. My project is a satirical remake of the show. I created a website to showcase my short film.

  Process: The original show inspired layout of the scenes, and the script was mostly improvised. I used online resources to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics, and coded a website that I'm hosting on GitHub.

  Reflection/Evaluation: I initially had a very different idea for my film, which was going to be something more of a philosophical exploration. There was meant to be only one actor. However, I decided to switch things up and tried to do something more fun.
