# Proposal draft

## Abstract

Social media usage had been increasing dramatically over the last decade, but the recent global pandemic has brought to the forefront concerns about people's attachment to their devices and their screen times. We are now at a time where doomscrolling online is the norm, but this has as much to do with global circumstances as the design of the platforms themselves. We propose an idea for novel mobile application, Goodscroll, which helps redefine the presence of technology in users' lives. Goodscroll serves primarily as an integrated and intelligent productivity system, with secondary social features that are designed to be less addictive and more meaningful than those of existing platforms. Goodscroll integrates with other digital tools such as Google Calendar, Notion, Quizlet,and Kindle to create a holistic productivity suite, while also allowing users to socialise online. The goal is to foremost cultivate more meaningful use of technology by creating a new system for organising and achieving a user's personal goals, and second to facilitate digital mindfuless through informed user experience design. 

## Introduction

In Greek mythology, Sisyphus is punished by the greek gods for trying to escape death. For all of eternity, Sisyphus is to roll a rock up a hill, only to have it roll back down again. The French existentialist philosopher Albert Camus saw in Sisyphus an image of the modern man — their actions rendered meaningless by virtue of being repetitive. Like Sisyphus, the modern man is guilty of repeating actions that bear little meaning or higher good. The Myth of Sisyphus makes a good analogy for thinking about today's internet culture, where we observe a significant rise in excessive and unproductive use of social media. 'Doomscrolling' is now more prevalent than ever, as users scroll through an endless feed of content on social media with nothing to show for it save for the hours lost to savvy social media algorithms.

However, although acutely aware of the absurdity of Sisyphus’s fate, Camus wrote, “one must imagine Sisyphus happy.” Sisyphus perhaps eventually realizes the futility of his efforts and that there is no innate value to his actions. For Sisyphus, and the daily tech user in the habit of endless scrolling, the value then must lie in some created meaning. For the latter, it is something that transforms the act of scrolling from passive consumption in an attention economy, to a deliberate activity offering fulfillment otherwise absent in conventional social media use. We propose a new digital platform, Goodscroll, which was born out of this very idea: to add value to users’ daily lives by helping them move from mindless scrolling to mindful scrolling.

Inspired by, yet distinct from, conventional social media or productivity apps, Goodscroll offers a very different experience in two major ways. First, users are not shown content shared by people who are not in their network. In this way, the content available for consumption to users is limited by design. Secondly, the app integrates with other digital tools a typical person might use in their day-to-day life, such as Google Calendar, Notion, Kindle, and so on, to deliver a novel and unified feed. By scraping data from other applications that are already being used by the user, Goodscroll can display relevant information to add newfound value to their scrolling time. A few possible integrations include A) showing the user a slide of their schedule for the next day, using data from Google Calendar, B) helping a student revise for their exam with study sets they had created on Quizlet, C) showing a quote/page from a book the user might want to read, which they might continue to read in-app if they chose to do so.

Goodscroll does not ask the user for a commitment at the get go: users just have to scroll away like they have always been doing. Instead, for example, by showing the user on their feed a page from a book that they’ve been meaning to read but they never got to starting, Goodscroll eliminates the effort involved in physically picking up a book and reading it, essentially minimising the gap between users and information that is directly relevant to them. Furthermore, by algorithmically placing relevant information on the user’s feed, it can harness the power of proven psychological tactics such as spaced repetition to also help the user retain the information they see, as opposed to the skimming through the unceasing influx of random information elsewhere on the internet. Goodscroll has leverage over other social/productivity apps mainly because, unlike most other apps, it does not need a viral movement to be engaging or useful to individual users. Rather than being a platform with “crowdfunded” content, Goodscroll’s content comes from the user themselves: most of it is generated automatically from the other tools a user is already using, and the rest are shared only by their closed circle of friends who also use the app.

In this proposal, we will provide the necessary background information on the problem of increase in social media use and decrease in productivity, and explain the different challenges and problems that Goodscroll aims to address. We will also discuss the exciting potential of this work and the impact it could have on individuals.

## Background / Related work

We now provide a brief overview in the context in which Goodscroll will eventaully be deployed. First, we discuss the rise in social media use classify users into different groups to identify the most vulnerable. It is almost conventional wisdom that such excess can be detrimental: for example, in a 2023 survey, 86% of adults believed social media use and teen depression rates were positively correlated. Thus, second, we enumerate several negative outcomes of said phenomenon, which have been well-documented in scientific literature. With this, we hope to justify the development of an alternative platform such as Goodscroll. [11]

### Rise in social media use

In a 2020 survey, 33% of adults responded that they were using more social media during after the COVID-19 outbreak than before [3]. This does not come as a surprise, given that the pandemic had forced people into their homes and to be alone with their devices. But the pandemic had only amplified an already existing upward trend. As of 2022, users worldwide spent an average of 2 hours and 27 minutes per day on social media, up from only 1 hour and 30 minutes 10 years ago [25]. However, to see the full picture, we delve into further classifications. We looked into whether users in a particular age group was more dedicated to social media than others. Unsurprisingly, it is Gen Z consumers who consume online content more than their older counterparts [6], and 93% of them report using social media at least once a week, higher than Millenials, Gen X, and Baby Boomers [9]. They were also the group with the lowest interactions with any online or offline newspapers, radio, and telivision, which indicates their preference for the accessible and unlimited entertainment that platforms such as Instagram and Tiktok offer. Certainly, the salience of such platforms have a lot to do with their popularity. It is far too easy to take your phone out to scroll through your feed than to pick up a book or newspaper when you have little time to spare, such as when waiting in a line or during a short daily commute. Younger consumers indicate social media to be their go-to entertainment when they had 15 minutes to spare [7] [8], and they are just as eager to keep at it for longer periods if they can [27] [28].

### Negative consequences

We now identify some of the negative impacts of excessive social media use on mental and physical health. Although our research does not directly aim at rectifying them, we deem this an essential piece of the discussion so as to understand the personal technology climate in mass society. We hope to show that by allowing Goodscroll a place in the user's daily lives, we can help mollify some of the dissatisfaction users express with their current social media habits. 

The negative effects of addiction to digital experiences can range from psychological and physical to societal and economic. For example, narcissism, low self-confidence and self-esteem, stress, poor concentration, ADHD, and atrophy of critical thinking have all been linked to social media addiction, along with sleep disturbance, various effects of sedentary digital addiction lifestyle, and productivity and opportunity costs [23]. These effects come to life by way of the premise of social networking, for example, people tend to engage in upward comparisons more frequently than downward comparisons, and so online, where there is scope for endless exposure to more successful or attractive individuals, people are more succeptible to lower self-esteem and poor self-evaluations [1].  To put the extent of some of these negative effects into perspective, over sixty percent of those who considered themselves addicted or somewhat addicted reported experiencing strong or nearly strong stress [13]. Moreover, around 15 percent of American college students believe that they suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [10]. Adolescents with higher daily social media use are more succeptible to mental health problems [16] and negative academic outcomes [22].

A study investigating normative dissociation, or total cognitive absorption in social media characterized by diminished self-awareness and reduced sense of agency, revealed just how easy it was to get swept away in the endless stream of online content. A participant described their experience saying, “Start with, I get some notification...[then] I go to the home thread, and I just start scrolling. Maybe sometimes I'll find a topic that's interesting and read the replies...I'm more of a consumer, and I don't engage too frequently. But my signal for mindlessly scrolling is I'm either seeing the same thing over and over...or I'm just scrolling through the main thread and exploring this breadth of topics, and then it becomes mindless when I realize this breadth of topics is not meaningful to me, and perhaps it makes me feel bad that I'm wasting this time doing something that's not actually has no bearing or is not meaningful to my life” [21]. Their response resonates with other participants, who are cognizant of their detrimental habits, which indicates to us a gap for a platform that can help them make their time spent online more meaningful.

## Methodology / Details

As discussed earlier, societiy's leaning on social media could be a result of various factors, including including the platforms' unassuming entry points and global circumstances such as the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the creators of these platforms cannot be written off as moralists, since the inherent design of their platforms are laid out to offer an easy gateway and encourage habitual use. In these section, we provide an overview of the psychological mechanisms engineered into popular social media platforms, so we can curate an experience for Goodscroll users that is more mindful and less detrimental. As such, Goodscroll's fundamental design principles are informed by scientific literature and understanding of the relationship between digital experiences and human psychology.

### Design of popular social media platforms versus ours

1. Erosion of natural stopping cues

Previously, online content was usually organized into discrete pages. When the user reached the end of a page, they were presented with a choice to view more content by continuing to the next page, or stop. However, with the introduction of the infinite scroll on Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, Twitter, and most other platforms, users' feeds are continuosly populated as they scroll, thereby removing the stopping cue. Unlike the page count that shows the user how much content they have viewed, here the user is bereft of any such estimation. Furthermore, a deluge of content means users are less likely to view or remember any of it, and so any important information is bount to lose visibility [15]. On the other hand, Goodscroll's feed is finite. Users can keep scrolling as they are used to, but they will eventually reach an end, since there is an upper limit on the available content. By maintining a closed network, users are not inundated with posts from people they do not know or sponsored content, and the productivity content, such as reminders of their upcoming tasks or exam flashcards, is inherently limited. As such, and further supported by research done on users being shown limited and curated content, users are more likely to actively engage with the information they view on the app [21].
 
2. Engagement cues

Among other things that can instigate a user to open a social application on their device, the effect of notifications is perhaps the strongest [23]. Notifications can be seen as variable-ratio reinforcement, which is a common mechanism in the gambling world. When the user receives a notification, its unpredictable nature - it could be a like, comment, or message - keeps them coming back for more. In contrast, Goodscroll eliminates out-of-app notifications. Users can still see a list of interactions with their posts in-app, but they are not distracted by notifications when they are not using the app. Furthermore, productivity notifications are redundant in this case and are not implemented, since reminders such as "you have an exam tomorrow" or "you have a meeting in 30 minutes" are already present in the user's calendar app.

3. Scope for seeking social approval

Humans are wired to seek social approval, and in a digital economy, that is exactly the purpose that likes, shares, and tags serve [23]. For example, Snapchat's "streaks" are a gamefied feature that encourages users to maintain a routine of exchanging pictures and videos, and higher streaks are a form of social reward and deemed to be a status symbol. Some users reportedly have held streaks for 1000 or more days. By eliminating the like feature, then, Goodscroll removes need for behaviours that are driven by social approval. Even in educational apps such as Duolingo, users can share their progress with their friends, but Goodscroll does not allow its users to share their daily productivity successes with others. Furthermore, since they cannot connect with the wider public, they are less likely to be vying for status or attention within their small group of friends they are already familiar with offline. In this lies another advantage Goodscroll has over other apps: it does not need a large user base to be useful to an individual user, since its reliance on other users for content is minimal. As such, we expect the penetration rate for Goodscroll to be higher than new social media apps that may rely on a virality to gain traction.

4. Anticipation and variable rewards

Social media applications are designed to maximise anticipation rather than reward, so users are never satisfied enough to close the app, but remain in a state where dissatisfaction drives consumption, in what is known as a Zeigarnik loop [23]. When the Twitter app is launched, a blue loading screen is displayed. While many might take this to be a result of poor network connection, this delay is in reality an engineered feature designed to generate anticipation for the following reward. On Pinterest, as the user reaches the end of the page, some images appear to be cut off. However, these images of a glimpse of what's ahead, and users are prompted to relieve their curiosity to scroll down and reveal the full picture [24]. Most of the content on the Goodscroll app is, however, generated by the user themselves: flashcards they had created for their exam, entries they had made in their to-do lists, or events they added to their calendars. As such, the reward is fixed rather than variable, and the anticipation element is reduced, as the user already knows what to expect, save for the small pool of content shared by their friends.

5. Algorithmically optimised feeds

The Tiktok algorithm is perhaps a prime example of this, although every other social media platform makes use of similar technology to mine users' data. The app's "For You" page is a feed of videos that are curated for each user based on their past interactions with the app. The algorithm learns users' preferences remarkably fast, so that they are always presented with new and interesting content, thus they are less likely to close the app. Furthermore, since these apps' business model is built on ad revenue, they need users to stay on the app for longer, so they can learn more about the users and show more relevant ads [23]. In contrast, there exists no profit incentive behind the development of Goodscroll, and so the app does not have a need for such algorithms. Goodscroll's algorithm is relatively minimally powerful, only meant to organise content in a convenient and useful way for the user.

6. Meta commentary

Although some social media apps have started to implement features to make users conscious of their time spent on the platform, however, this practice is in direct conflict with their business model, which is to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. For example, Instagram's "You're all caught up" feature was introduced in 2018 to let users know when they had seen all the new posts from the past 48 hours. However, this feature was removed in 2020, since it was found to reduce the time spent on the app. While we do not expect users to spend long periods of time on end on Goodscroll, users may still be engaged in longer, more productive activities, such as reading pages from a book on the app. Research suggests that disruptions such as time limit notifications or reminders to take a break can undermine the user experience [21]. As such, Goodscroll will have a footer that changes colour in a spectrum as more time is spent on the app, so that users not interrupted but rather made conscious of the time spent. The time it takes for the footer to go from the inital to the final color can be user-determined, allowing users to self-regulate. Furthermore, to re-engage self-awareness, the app will periodically display slides on the feed that remind users of their upcoming tasks or deadlines, which can help them disengage with the app if they wish to do so, overall leading to further satisfaction from a feeling of control over their lives.


### Technology Stack

1. SwiftUI and Server-Side Swift Development

To create a seamless and efficient user experience, the choice of our development environment for Goodscroll is SwiftUI, a user interface toolkit that allows the design of apps for all Apple platforms with a single codebase. This will enable faster development and ensure that the app runs smoothly on various Apple devices. Server-side Swift will be employed to manage the backend services, as it provides the ability to create scalable, high-performance systems. By using Swift for both frontend and backend development, the app will benefit from streamlined code management and reduced development time.

2. Intelligent Feed Organization

Goodscroll will use a proprietary algorithm to intelligently organize productivity content on the user's feed based on relevance and urgency. The social posts shared by their friends will be sorted in order of date posted. This will ensure that the user's attention is drawn to the most important things first, and they are not overwhelmed by a surge of content. The algorithm will also manage any meta commentary that is displayed on the feed, such as the color changing footer or reminders for upcoming tasks.

3. API Integration with Third-Party Applications

Goodscroll will integrate with various third-party applications through their APIs to offer uses a personalised and unified feed. Users can choose from a list and indicate which apps they currently use and easily connect them with their Goodscroll feed. By sourcing content from popular tools like Google Calendar, Notion, and Quizlet, Goodscroll will be able to display relevant information from these platforms directly within the app. This integration will allow users to access and engage with content from multiple sources in a single, centralized location, thus enhancing the user experience. The use of APIs will also ensure that the app remains up-to-date with any changes or updates to the integrated platforms, providing a seamless and uninterrupted experience for the user.

## Project Planning / Timeline / Budgetary Request

### Timeline

The project planning timeline for Goodscroll will be based on the Scrum framework, a popular Agile project management methodology. Scrum promotes iterative and incremental development, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation throughout the project. The development for Goodscroll is divided into several key phases, each with specific milestones and deadlines. This timeline will ensure that the development process remains on track and that the app is completed within the desired timeframe.

Phase 1: Research and Conceptualization (Duration: 6 weeks)

Sprint 1: Develop sound understanding of Swift fundamentals and APIs
Sprint 2: Develop the concept for Goodscroll, create user stories, and outline key features
Sprint 3: Finalize the app's overall design and user interface, and create mockups
Sprint 4: Review and refine the concept, and prepare for the development phase

Phase 2: Development (Duration: 8 weeks)

Sprint 1: Develop the frontend using SwiftUI, focusing on the user interface and user experience
Sprint 2: Develop the backend using server-side Swift, implement the intelligent task organization algorithm, and integrate APIs for third-party applications
Sprint 3: Conduct initial testing and debugging, and make any necessary adjustments

Phase 3: Deployment and Marketing (Duration: 4 weeks)

Sprint 1: Finalize the app for release, including addressing any remaining bugs and implementing user feedback
Sprint 2: Prepare the app for submission to the App Store and develop promotional materials
Sprint 3: Launch the app on the App Store and initiate marketing efforts to attract users
Sprint 4: Monitor app performance, gather user feedback, and make necessary updates

### Budget

The budget has been itemized into three primary categories: App Store fees, which will go towards distrubting the app on the iOS store for 1 year [https://developer.apple.com/programs/], compensation for market research participants (100 dirham gift cards for about 20 participants), and deployment overhead, such as DigitalOcean subscription costs for services including running droplets, dataabases, and spaces.

| Item                                          | Cost (in USD) |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| App store fees                                | $100          |
| Compensation for market research participants | $600          |
| Deployment overhead                           | $300          |

## Concluding remarks

This proposal highlights the project's commitment to delivering a high-quality, user-centric platform that can have a lasting impact on its users' digital well-being. In conclusion, Goodscroll is built on three pillars: 1) utilizing technology in personal growth, 2) maintaining digital minimalism in an age of information overload, and 3) decentralizing social media. Like Sisyphus, we have the choice to embrace the absurdity of our digital existence and find meaning by transforming our habits and perspectives. By promoting mindful scrolling and fostering a more relevant, personalized experience, Goodscroll invites us to redefine our relationship with the digital world, and in doing so, discover a more meaningful and fulfilling existence. As we move forward with this project, we remain dedicated to our driving principles and creating a fulfilling digital existence for all.
