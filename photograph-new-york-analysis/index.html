          Before making its last stop at the Brooklyn Museum, <i>Thierry Mugler:
          Couturissime</i> had traveled through Montreal, Munich, Rotterdam and
          Paris, showcasing about 130 outfits, accessories, videos, photographs,
          sketches and fragrances. The exhibition is a stunning testament to
          Manfred Thierry Mugler’s legacy in fashion and is the first ever
          retrospective dedicated to the designer. Having started out in the
          70s, he redefined standards in design and inspired many prominent
          figures of the later decades, from Alessandro Michele to Alexander
          McQueen. Mugler’s work resounds creativity and empowered
          self-expression: as the epigraph to the show quotes him, “in my work
          I’ve always tried to make people look stronger than they really are.”
          In its strokes of energy, authenticity, and pizzazz, <i>Couturissime</i>,
          parallels a contending exhibition: my closet.

          My <i>closet</i> has traveled with me, from Dhaka to Abu Dhabi to New
          York, and the ensemble is the culmination of 22 years of my selfhood.
          It’s hard to put a pin on what’s going in there: the straw hat I
          picked out of a donation box, the tote bag I painted with friends in
          freshman year, the H&M t-shirt that I bought because it looked like
          the cover of a Penguin classic, and the thrifted Ralph Lauren
          button-down shirt with yellowed cuffs all make up a cross between
          inspirations and anti-trends, together holding out against attempts to
          define a modus operandi. It is a reflection of my resistance to
          identify with a subculture and struggle against the opposing forces.
          There is a world of mechanisms in place to drive the hyper-consumerist
          society, and between the micro-trends and fast fashion empires, it
          seems to me that universal ideas of the authentic self have been lost
          somewhere along the way. In pursuing authentic expression and creative
          risks, who is better to look up to, than Thierry Mugler himself?

          <i>Couturissime</i> delivers, without dilution, a sense of the grandiose and
          innovative vision of the world that Mugler had. The exhibition is
          broken down into galleries that don’t follow a chronological order,
          owing to Mugler’s dislike of presenting a tepid display of clothes.
          Instead, the rooms are presided over by close to life mannequins in
          outfits that are the very definition of camp: gowns with crystal and
          feather embellishments, bodysuits in duchesse satin sheaths, and wool
          suits with embossed satin trims. Some outfits come out and turn upside
          down the limits of imagination, such as the <i>derrière décolleté</i> skirt
          with a proudly conspicuous cutout for ‘butt cleavage’. Other artwear
          highlight Mugler’s penchant for unconventional materials, including
          glass, PVC, latex, chrome, pushing sartorial boundaries and draping
          the mannequins in sci-fi, animalic, or feminine mystique. Perhaps my
          favorite, if only one could be singled out, would be the bustier with
          the radiator grille and headlight adornments, with handlebars
          extending from the midriff. Gradioise as it is, Couturissime is
          altogether an ode to Mugler’s embrace of the unimagined.

          Although my closet resembles nothing of Thierry Mugler’s flamboyance,
          it still bears his philosophy. Mugler’s life and work stands as a
          subversion of the imagined ideal of rote categorizations and coercive
          conformity, and which reminds one of Sartre’s idea of “existence
          precedes essence”. A table, for example, bears a purpose even before
          it comes into existence, that is, to be used as a table. The same
          cannot be said about a human, who may live a life in its entirety
          without realizing their true essence, one that they must have sought
          out on their own. The modern industrial world is unsympathetic to ways
          of living that contradict its bookkeeping and mass manufacturing
          agenda: between buying the same groceries every week, renewing the
          same drivers license until you die, and earning a fixed hourly wage,
          there is little space left for a man to discover his true essence.
          When I look at my clothes, the outfits that I mismatch, and the lost
          socks that I substitute, I see a conscious aversion to labels, such
          that if you asked if it’s a goth, athlete, or a nerd’s doing, you would
          at least struggle to find an answer. The fear at play is an awareness
          of how much my social and cultural context has shaped my being, and
          worse, that they become limiting agents. If the unimagined, novel, and
          extraordinary is the result of creative pursuit, then that creativity
          must come from the pursuit and preservation of each person’s unique
          essence. I think about the 19th century Italian sculptor Giovanni
          Strazza, who could carve cloth out of stone, and I wonder why his
          masterpiece <i>The Veiled Virgin</i> is in a museum to be looked upon as lost
          art from the past. I think about Muslin from 17th century Bengal, so
          light that feet of fabric could fit into a matchbox, and its expert
          weavers whose craft died with them when they made way for the garment
          industry. At this pace, how far are we from the extinction of art and
          creativity?

          When I open my closet doors, I see the ghost of Thierry Mugler in my
          colorblocked t-shirts and vintage windbreakers. When I wear my
          clothes, and go out for the day, I hope for a society that welcomes
          the pursuit and preservation of my essence.
